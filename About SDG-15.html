    <h3>Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, 
        combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
    </h3>

            Human life depends on the earth as much as the ocean for our sustenance and livelihoods. Plant life 
            provides 80 percent of the human diet, and we rely on agriculture as an important economic resource. 
            Forests cover 30 percent of the Earth’s surface, provide vital habitats for millions of species, and 
            important sources for clean air and water, as well as being crucial for combating climate change.

            Every year, 13 million hectares of forests are lost, while the persistent degradation of drylands has 
            led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares, disproportionately affecting poor communities.

            While 15 percent of land is protected, biodiversity is still at risk. Nearly 7,000 species of animals 
            and plants have been illegally traded. Wildlife trafficking not only erodes biodiversity, but creates 
            insecurity, fuels conflict, and feeds corruption.

            Urgent action must be taken to reduce the loss of natural habitats and biodiversity which are part of 
            our common heritage and support global food and water security, climate change mitigation and 
            adaptation, and peace and security.
